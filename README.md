# Mint NFTs with $SOS - smart contract base template

## How it works

The buyer needs to approved $SOS transfers to the NFT contract, and upon minting the contract transfers the amount set for mint.

## Current state

This is a proof of concept that has assumes you have an NFT with a supply of 10,000, a fixed mint price, and an unlimited mint amount (i.e., no whitelisting). The contract compiles successfully but has no test or deployment script. There are a million different directions this project can be taken, so feel free to fork and make it your own or put in a PR with a cool idea you have.
